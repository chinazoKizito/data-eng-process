# data-eng-process
An-end-to-end-data-science-process, where income and expenses data from an excel file is read, dates enriched with pandas datetime properties and then exported to a csv file. This new data in a csv format is then saved in an sqlite database to enable SQL functionalities on it. The data saved in the database is then retrieved directly into a pandas dataframe where analysis will be done on the data and machine learning algorithms applied to the data to derive insights. code and output can be viewed in this notebook "end-to-end-data-science-process.ipynb".
